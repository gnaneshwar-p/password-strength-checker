# Password Strength Checker and Suggestions

## Overview

This project is a **Password Strength Checker** built using **JavaScript** and **zxcvbn** (a password strength estimation library). The app evaluates the strength of a password based on various factors such as length, complexity, and character variety. It then provides real-time feedback to users, suggesting how they can improve their password for greater security.

### Features:
- **Real-time password strength evaluation**: As the user types, the password strength is analyzed, and a score from 0 to 4 is provided.
- **Strength Feedback**: Clear feedback on the strength of the password (weak, moderate, strong).
- **Password Suggestions**: Based on the strength of the password, suggestions are provided to improve its security.
- **User-friendly UI**: Simple interface where users can easily check and improve their password strength.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: 
  - HTML, CSS for the structure and styling.
  - JavaScript for the logic and real-time updates.
  - **zxcvbn** library to evaluate password strength.

- **Backend** (optional for more advanced usage):
